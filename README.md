## Description

This project is a personal portfolio which is built using React. My motivation for this project was to build something I could showcase to potential future employers and be able to stand out from others. 

## Problem Solving

This project aims at providing a well made portfolio to showcase.

## Learning

Throughout building this project, I learned how components work as well as many other React features. It was interesting to see everything come together and work.
